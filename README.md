🏠 # King County, Washington DC – House Sales Dashboard
Welcome to an insightful journey into the housing market of King County, Washington DC. This interactive dashboard serves as a comprehensive visualization of housing trends, prices, and patterns derived from real estate transactions during August 2014. Built using Tableau, this dashboard is an exploration of how data can bring to life the underlying trends of home buying and selling in a vibrant region.

📅 # Filter by Time and Property Attributes
At the heart of this dashboard lies a robust filter panel on the left, offering a dynamic way to explore the data:

Calendar and Dropdown allow users to select specific dates and months, helping them analyze trends across different timeframes.

Sliders for Year Built, Sqft Lot, and Sqft Living allow users to drill into specific home attributes and observe how these influence price and distribution.

This customization enables a hands-on, explorative experience—giving you the power to compare homes built in different decades or compare small lots with sprawling estates.

📈 # Daily Average Sales – What’s the Trend?
The centerpiece line chart tells the story of daily average house prices throughout the month. What initially appears to be a stable market soon reveals subtle price fluctuations. The graph shows a mid-month peak, followed by a slight dip and a final surge toward the month’s end. This fluctuation might reflect weekly buyer patterns, economic influences, or even weather-driven behavior in real estate activity.

🗺️ # Map – Where Are Homes Selling?
To the right, a beautiful heatmap-style geographic visualization shows property sales spread across King County. With deep purples, reds, and oranges indicating varying price intensities, you can visually identify high-value zones like Seattle suburbs and coastal neighborhoods. Hovering over regions reveals deeper insights, allowing viewers to correlate geography with property values.

🧾 # View vs Condition Map – The Hidden Influence
This unique matrix table blends home condition (Excellent, Good, Fair) with view quality (Waterfront, City, None) to expose how aesthetics and property care influence pricing. Unsurprisingly, homes in Excellent condition with top-tier views fetch the highest prices—sometimes over $1 million. Conversely, poorly maintained homes with no view significantly drop in value, often to below $300K.

📊 # Distribution of House Prices
A histogram dives deeper into the price spectrum. Most properties fall between $200K–$600K, showcasing King County’s mid-tier affordability at that time. But there are noticeable tails stretching to the million-dollar mark—likely representing luxury estates or prime locations.

🛏️ # Bedrooms and 🛁 Bathrooms – What Do Buyers Prefer?
Two histograms summarize the bedroom and bathroom counts across homes. Four-bedroom homes emerge as the most common, suggesting a trend toward family-sized living. Similarly, most houses offer 2 to 2.5 bathrooms, striking a balance between comfort and construction efficiency.

🔍 Conclusion
This dashboard is more than just charts—it's a storytelling tool that empowers users to uncover the “why” behind housing prices. Whether you're a first-time homebuyer, an economist, or a data enthusiast, this Tableau visualization offers a meaningful and interactive glance into the housing market of King County.
